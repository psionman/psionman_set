Creating Blog Posts
*******************

Blog posts go in the *_posts* directory. The should be named using the convention:

.. code-block:: console

    yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-your-choice.markdown
    
(the extension *md* is acceptable).
    
1. Create a file and it immediately ap on the home page.pears. It will use the *name-of-your-choice* as the title, until you create front matter.

2. The front matter *layout* gives a *style* to the page:

.. code-block:: console

    layout: post
    
3. Sub directires can be created in *_posts* and all files in those directories will be rendered.

4. Drafts can go in a folder called *_drafts*.
