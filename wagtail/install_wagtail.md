#### Installing wagtail


1.  If not already done, create a directory to contain your wagtail project. In my case

    ~/projects/wagtail_tutorial

2.  Create a virtual environment for wagtail

    ``` console
    mkvirtualenv wagtail
    ```

3.  Enter the virtual env:

    ``` console
    workon wagtail
    ```

4.  Install Django:

    ``` console
    python -m pip install Django
    ```

5.  Install Wagtail:

    ``` console
    pip install wagtail
   ```
